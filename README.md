# Core protocol implementation for FTY

## Scope and goals

Implementation of core protocols (assets, metrics, alerts messages) for 42ity
project. fty-proto defines [grammar](src/fty_proto.bnf) of messages as well as [C API](doc/fty_proto.txt) to serialize/deserialize messages.

It defines three types of main messages on the system
* metrics
* assets
* alerts

## Building and Installing

You need libzmq and czmq prior to building fty-proto.

### Using Open Build Service

Zeromq community maintain packages [network:zeromq](https://download.opensuse.org/...) for a lot of Linux distributions. Check if your system is supported and install devel packagage of czmq (libczmq-dev, czmq-devel).

### From source code

Here's how to build CZMQ from GitHub (building from packages is very similar, you don't clone a repo but unpack a tarball), including the libzmq (ZeroMQ core) library (NOTE: skip ldconfig on OSX):

    git clone git://github.com/zeromq/libzmq.git
    cd libzmq
    ./autogen.sh
    # do not specify "--with-libsodium" if you prefer to use internal tweetnacl security implementation (recommended for development)
    ./configure --with-libsodium
    make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    cd ..

    git clone git://github.com/zeromq/czmq.git
    cd czmq
    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    cd ..

Then build fty-proto itself

    git clone git://github.com/42ity/fty-proto.git
    cd fty-proto
    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make check
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig
    cd ..

## API summary

See [fty_proto.txt](doc/fty_proto.txt) for API summary and example code.

## Development

fty-proto is developed through a test-driven process that guarantees no memory violations or leaks in the code:

* Modify a class or method.
* Update the test method for that class.
* Run the 'selftest' script, which uses the Valgrind memcheck tool.
* Repeat until perfect.

Allways ask - can I make it simpler?
