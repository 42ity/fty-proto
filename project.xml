<!--
    The project.xml generates build environments for:

        * android
        * autotool
        * cmake
        * mingw32
        * cygwin
        * vs2008
        * vs2010
        * vs2012
        * vs2013

    Classes are automatically added to all build environments. Further as you
    add new classes to your project you can generate skeleton header and source
    files according to http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:21.

    name := The name of your project
    description := A short description for your project
    script := The gsl script to generate all the stuff !!! DO NOT CHANGE !!!
    email := The email address where to reach you project e.g. mailinglist.

        Actors, are build using the simple actor framework from czmq. If the
        actors class header or source file doesn't exist this will generate a
        skeleton for them. The generated test method of the actor will teach
        you how to use them. Also have a look at the czmq docs to learn more
        about actors.

        Models that we build using GSL.
        This will generate a 'make code' target to build the models.
    <model name = "sockopts" />

    <model name = "zgossip_msg" />

        If a model should be generated using a specific gsl script,
        this can be set through the script attribute:
    <model name = "hydra_msg" script = "zproto_codec_java.gsl" />

        Additional parameters to the script can be set via nested
        param elements:
    <model name = "hydra_msg" script = "zproto_codec_java.gsl">
        <param name = "root_path" value = "../main" />
    </model>

    <extra name = "some_resource" />
