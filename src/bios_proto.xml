    The software maintains three main types of information divided to three streams

    1. Stream: ASSETS - semi-static data about changes in assets, see ASSET message
    2. Stream: METRICS - dynamic information about metric data coming from varous devices
    3. Stream: ALERTS - information about alerts produced for given asset based on metric information
